# Mockingbird
Mockingbird is a mock api developed in ASP.Net library code that will help developers community setup fake endpoints for testing their RESTful applications.

By setting up this ASP.Net website on a server RESTful developers can quickly cook up new endpoints for a quick tests. This is also useful when downstream applications endpoints are temporarly unavailable or have changed the response. To keep up with ever changing consuming applications such mocking setup will help developers from blockers.

I have experienced blockers in during or post development efforts due to maintainance work on depedency applications, or some kind of configuration issues.
