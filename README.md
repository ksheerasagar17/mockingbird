# Mockingbird
Mockingbird is a simple ASP.Net web application code that will help developers setup fake endpoints for sake of development and testing in RESTful applications.

After configuration, this application can be used to mocking the response from a RESTful server, hence the name mockingbird.

By setting up this ASP.Net website on a server; developers can quickly cook up new RESTful api endpoints. There are useful especially when dependencya application endpoints are temporarly unavailable or have changed the response. To keep up with ever changing consuming applications such mocking setup will help developers from blockers.

I have experienced blockers in during or post development efforts due to maintainance work on depedency applications, or some kind of configuration issues.
